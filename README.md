# b64s-package-test - check published b64s wheels

This checks published `b64s` PyPI/TestPyPI wheels. It exists to make it easier
for me to check my work when I try out new tools for building and uploading
wheels. This repository contains neither `b64s` nor its actual unit tests.

*If you found this by searching, you're probably looking for
[b64s](https://github.com/EliahKagan/b64s) instead.*
